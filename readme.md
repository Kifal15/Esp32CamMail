# ESP32-CAM: Take and Send Photos via Email using an SMTP Server 
This project is compatible with any ESP32 camera board with the OV2640 camera. You just need to make sure you use the right pin assignment for the board you’re using: ESP32-CAM Camera Boards: Pin and GPIOs Assignment Guide.

# ESP32 MailClient Library
To send emails with the ESP32-CAM, we’ll use the ESP32 MailClient library. This library allows the ESP32 to send and receive emails with or without attachment via SMTP and IMAP servers.
